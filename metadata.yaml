description: As well as with his novels, much of Arnold Bennett's non-fiction work
  has stood the test of time. One of his most popular non-fiction works, which is
  still read to this day, is the self-help book "How to Live on 24 Hours a Day". His
  diaries have yet to be published in full, but extracts from them are often quoted
  in the British press. Bennett also wrote for the stage and the screen. The Author's
  Craft, contains some of Bennett's essays on the art of writing, with his thoughts
  on applying the craft to both novel and play writing ...
