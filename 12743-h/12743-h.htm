    <h3>I</h3>

    <p>A young dog, inexperienced, sadly lacking in even primary
    education, ambles and frisks along the footpath of Fulham Road,
    near the mysterious gates of a Marist convent. He is a large
    puppy, on the way to be a dog of much dignity, but at present
    he has little to recommend him but that gawky elegance, and
    that bounding gratitude for the gift of life, which distinguish
    the normal puppy. He is an ignorant fool. He might have entered
    the convent of nuns and had a fine time, but instead he steps
    off the pavement into the road, the road being a vast and
    interesting continent imperfectly explored. His confidence in
    his nose, in his agility, and in the goodness of God is
    touching, absolutely painful to witness. He glances casually at
    a huge, towering vermilion construction that is
<!-- Page 8 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page004" name="page004">[pg 4]</a>
    </span>

    whizzing towards him on four wheels, preceded by a glint of
    brass and a wisp of steam; and then with disdain he ignores it
    as less important than a mere speck of odorous matter in the
    mud. The next instant he is lying inert in the mud. His
    confidence in the goodness of God had been misplaced. Since the
    beginning of time God had ordained him a victim.</p>

    <p>An impressive thing happens. The motor-bus reluctantly
    slackens and stops. Not the differential brake, nor the
    foot-brake, has arrested the motor-bus, but the invisible brake
    of public opinion, acting by administrative transmission. There
    is not a policeman in sight. Theoretically, the motor-'bus is
    free to whiz onward in its flight to the paradise of
    Shoreditch, but in practice it is paralysed by dread. A man in
    brass buttons and a stylish cap leaps down from it, and the
    blackened demon who sits on its neck also leaps down from it,
    and they move gingerly towards the puppy. A little while ago
<!-- Page 9 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page005" name="page005">[pg 5]</a>
    </span>

    the motor-bus might have overturned a human cyclist or so, and
    proceeded nonchalant on its way. But now even a puppy requires
    a post-mortem: such is the force of public opinion aroused. Two
    policemen appear in the distance.</p>

    <p>"A street accident" is now in being, and a crowd gathers
    with calm joy and stares, passive and determined. The puppy
    offers no sign whatever; just lies in the road. Then a boy,
    destined probably to a great future by reason of his singular
    faculty of initiative, goes to the puppy and carries him by the
    scruff of the neck, to the shelter of the gutter. Relinquished
    by the boy, the lithe puppy falls into an easy horizontal
    attitude, and seems bent upon repose. The boy lifts the puppy's
    head to examine it, and the head drops back wearily. The puppy
    is dead. No cry, no blood, no disfigurement! Even no
    perceptible jolt of the wheel as it climbed over the obstacle
    of the puppy's body! A wonderfully clean and perfect
    accident!</p>

    <p>
<!-- Page 10 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page006" name="page006">[pg 6]</a>
    </span>

    The increasing crowd stares with beatific placidity. People
    emerge impatiently from the bowels of the throbbing motor-bus
    and slip down from its back, and either join the crowd or
    vanish. The two policemen and the crew of the motor-bus have
    now met in parley. The conductor and the driver have an air at
    once nervous and resigned; their gestures are quick and
    vivacious. The policemen, on the other hand, indicate by their
    slow and huge movements that eternity is theirs. And they could
    not be more sure of the conductor and the driver if they had
    them manacled and leashed. The conductor and the driver admit
    the absolute dominion of the elephantine policemen; they admit
    that before the simple will of the policemen inconvenience,
    lost minutes, shortened leisure, docked wages, count as less
    than naught. And the policemen are carelessly sublime, well
    knowing that magistrates, jails, and the very Home Secretary on
    his throne&#8212;yes, and a whole system of conspiracy
<!-- Page 11 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page007" name="page007">[pg 7]</a>
    </span>

    and perjury and brutality&#8212;are at their beck in case of
    need. And yet occasionally in the demeanour of the policemen
    towards the conductor and the driver there is a silent message
    that says: "After all, we, too, are working men like you,
    over-worked and under-paid and bursting with grievances in the
    service of the pitiless and dishonest public. We, too, have
    wives and children and privations and frightful apprehensions.
    We, too, have to struggle desperately. Only the awful magic of
    these garments and of the garter which we wear on our wrists
    sets an abyss between us and you." And the conductor writes and
    one of the policemen writes, and they keep on writing, while
    the traffic makes beautiful curves to avoid them.</p>

    <p>The still increasing crowd continues to stare in the pure
    blankness of pleasure. A close-shaved, well-dressed,
    middle-aged man, with a copy of
    <i>The Sportsman</i>

    in his podgy hand, who has descended from the motor-bus, starts
    stamping his feet. "I was knocked down by a taxi last year," he

<!-- Page 12 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page008" name="page008">[pg 8]</a>
    </span>

    says fiercely. "But nobody took no notice of
    <i>that</i>

    ! Are they going to stop here all the blank morning for a blank
    tyke?" And for all his respectable appearance, his features
    become debased, and he emits a jet of disgusting profanity and
    brings most of the Trinity into the thunderous assertion that
    he has paid his fare. Then a man passes wheeling a muck-cart.
    And he stops and talks a long time with the other uniforms,
    because he, too, wears vestiges of a uniform. And the crowd
    never moves nor ceases to stare. Then the new arrival stoops
    and picks up the unclaimed, masterless puppy, and flings it,
    all soft and yielding, into the horrid mess of the cart, and
    passes on. And only that which is immortal and divine of the
    puppy remains behind, floating perhaps like an invisible vapour
    over the scene of the tragedy.</p>

    <p>The crowd is tireless, all eyes. The four principals still
    converse and write. Nobody in the crowd comprehends what they
    are about. At length the driver
<!-- Page 13 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page009" name="page009">[pg 9]</a>
    </span>

    separates himself, but is drawn back, and a new parley is
    commenced. But everything ends. The policemen turn on their
    immense heels. The driver and conductor race towards the
    motor-bus. The bell rings, the motor-bus, quite empty,
    disappears snorting round the corner into Walham Green. The
    crowd is now lessening. But it separates with reluctance, many
    of its members continuing to stare with intense absorption at
    the place where the puppy lay or the place where the policemen
    stood. An appreciable interval elapses before the "street
    accident" has entirely ceased to exist as a phenomenon.</p>

    <p>The members of the crowd follow their noses, and during the
    course of the day remark to acquaintances:</p>

    <p>"Saw a dog run over by a motor-bus in the Fulham Road this
    morning! Killed dead!"</p>

    <p>And that is all they do remark. That is all they have
    witnessed. They will not, and could not, give intelligible and
    in
<!-- Page 14 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page010" name="page010">[pg 10]</a>
    </span>

    teresting particulars of the affair (unless it were as to the
    breed of the dog or the number of the bus-service). They have
    watched a dog run over. They analyse neither their sensations
    nor the phenomenon. They have witnessed it whole, as a bad
    writer uses a
    <i>clich&#233;</i>

    . They have observed&#8212;that is to say, they have really
    seen&#8212;nothing.</p>

    <p>It will be well for us not to assume an attitude of
    condescension towards the crowd. Because in the matter of
    looking without seeing we are all about equal. We all go to and
    fro in a state of the observing faculties which somewhat
    resembles coma. We are all content to look and not see.</p>

    <p>And if and when, having comprehended that the
    <i>r&#244;le</i>

    of observer is not passive but active, we determine by an
    effort to rouse ourselves from the coma and really to see the
    spectacle of the world (a spectacle surpassing circuses and
    even street accidents in sustained dramatic interest), we shall
    discover, slowly in the course of time, that the act of seeing,
    which seems so easy, is not so easy as it seems. Let a man
    resolve: "I will keep my eyes open on the way to the office of
    a morning,"
<!-- Page 16 -->

    </span>

    and the probability if that for many mornings he will see
    naught that is not trivial, and that his system of perspective
    will be absurdly distorted. The unusual, the unaccustomed, will
    infallibly attract him, to the exclusion of what is fundamental
    and universal. Travel makes observers of us all, but the things
    which as travellers we observe generally show how unskilled we
    are in the new activity.</p>

    <p>A man went to Paris for the first time, and observed right
    off that the carriages of suburban trains had seats on the roof
    like a tramcar. He was so thrilled by the remarkable discovery
    that he observed almost nothing else. This enormous fact
    occupied the whole foreground of his perspective. He returned
    home and announced that Paris was a place where people rode on
    the tops of trains. A Frenchwoman came to London for the first
    time&#8212;and no English person would ever guess the
    phenomenon which vanquished all others in her mind on the
<!-- Page 17 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page013" name="page013">[pg 13]</a>
    </span>

    opening day. She saw a cat walking across a street. The vision
    excited her. For in Paris cats do not roam in thoroughfares,
    because there are practically no houses with gardens or
    "areas"; the flat system is unfavourable to the enlargement of
    cats. I remember once, in the days when observation had first
    presented itself to me as a beautiful pastime, getting up very
    early and making the circuit of inner London before summer dawn
    in quest of interesting material. And the one note I gathered
    was that the ground in front of the all-night coffee-stalls was
    white with egg-shells! What I needed then was an operation for
    cataract. I also remember taking a man to the opera who had
    never seen an opera. The work was
    <i>Lohengrin</i>

    . When we came out he said: "That swan's neck was rather
    stiff." And it was all he did say. We went and had a drink. He
    was not mistaken. His observation was most just; but his
    perspective was that of those literary critics who give ten
    lines to point
<!-- Page 18 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page014" name="page014">[pg 14]</a>

    ing out three slips of syntax, and three lines to an
    ungrammatical admission that the novel under survey is not
    wholly tedious.</p>

    <p>But a man may acquire the ability to observe even a large
    number of facts, and still remain in the infantile stage of
    observation. I have read, in some work of literary criticism,
    that Dickens could walk up one side of a long, busy street and
    down the other, and then tell you in their order the names on
    all the shop-signs; the fact was alleged as an illustration of
    his great powers of observation. Dickens was a great observer,
    but he would assuredly have been a still greater observer had
    he been a little less pre-occupied with trivial and
    unco-ordinated details. Good observation consists not in
    multiplicity of detail, but in co-ordination of detail
    according to a true perspective of relative importance, so that
    a finally just general impression may be reached in the
    shortest possible time. The skilled observer is he who does not
    have to change

    </span>

    his mind. One has only to compare one's present adjusted
    impression of an intimate friend with one's first impression of
    him to perceive the astounding inadequacy of one's powers of
    observation. The man as one has learnt to see him is simply not
    the same man who walked into one's drawing-room on the day of
    introduction.</p>

    <p>There are, by the way, three sorts of created beings who are
    sentimentally supposed to be able to judge individuals at the
    first glance: women, children, and dogs. By virtue of a mystic
    gift with which rumour credits them, they are never mistaken.
    It is merely not true. Women are constantly quite wrong in the
    estimates based on their "feminine instinct"; they sometimes
    even admit it; and the matrimonial courts prove it
    <i>passim</i>

    . Children are more often wrong than women. And as for dogs, it
    is notorious that they are for ever being taken in by plausible
    scoundrels; the perspective of dogs is grotesque. Not

    seldom have I grimly watched the gradual disillusion of
    deceived dogs. Nevertheless, the sentimental legend of the
    infallibility of women, children, and dogs, will persist in
    Anglo-Saxon countries.</p>

    <p>One is curious about one's fellow-creatures: therefore one
    watches them. And generally the more intelligent one is, the
    more curious one is, and the more one observes. The mere
    satisfaction of this curiosity is in itself a worthy end, and
    would alone justify the business of systematised observation.
    But the aim of observation may, and should, be expressed in
    terms more grandiose. Human curiosity counts among the highest
    social virtues (as indifference counts among the basest
    defects), because it leads to the disclosure of the causes of
    character and temperament and thereby to a better understanding
    of the springs of human conduct. Observation is not practised
    directly with this high end in view (save by prigs and other
    futile souls); nevertheless it is a moral act and must
    inevitably

    promote kindliness&#8212;whether we like it or not. It also
    sharpens the sense of beauty. An ugly deed&#8212;such as a deed
    of cruelty&#8212;takes on artistic beauty when its origin and
    hence its fitness in the general scheme begin to be
    comprehended. In the perspective of history we can derive an
    &#230;sthetic pleasure from the tranquil scrutiny of all kinds
    of conduct&#8212;as well, for example, of a Renaissance Pope as
    of a Savonarola. Observation endows our day and our street with
    the romantic charm of history, and stimulates charity&#8212;not
    the charity which signs cheques, but the more precious charity
    which puts itself to the trouble of understanding. The one
    condition is that the observer must never lose sight of the
    fact that what he is trying to see is life, is the woman next
    door, is the man in the train&#8212;and not a concourse of
    abstractions. To appreciate all this is the first inspiring
    preliminary to sound observation.</p>

    <p>The second preliminary is to realise that all physical
    phenomena are interrelated, that there is nothing which does
    not bear on everything else. The whole spectacular and sensual
    show&#8212;what the eye sees, the ear hears, the nose scents,
    the tongue tastes and the skin touches&#8212;is a cause or an
    effect of human conduct. Naught can be ruled out as negligible,
    as not forming part of the equation. Hence he who would beyond
    all others see life for himself&#8212;I naturally mean the
    novelist and playwright&#8212;ought to embrace all phenomena in
    his curiosity. Being finite, he cannot. Of course he cannot!
    But he can, by obtaining a broad notion of the whole, determine
    with some accuracy the position and relative importance of the
    particular series of phenomena to which his instinct draws him.
    If he

    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page020" name="page020">[pg 20]</a>
    </span>

    does not thus envisage the immense background of his special
    interests, he will lose the most precious feeling for interplay
    and proportion without which all specialism becomes distorted
    and positively darkened.</p>

    <p>Now, the main factor in life on this planet is the planet
    itself. Any logically conceived survey of existence must begin
    with geographical and climatic phenomena. This is surely
    obvious. If you say that you are not interested in meteorology
    or the configurations of the earth, I say that you deceive
    yourself. You are. For an east wind may upset your liver and
    cause you to insult your wife. Beyond question the most
    important fact about, for example, Great Britain is that it is
    an island. We sail amid the Hebrides, and then talk of the fine
    qualities and the distressing limitations of those islanders;
    it ought to occur to us English that we are talking of
    ourselves in little. In moments of journalistic vainglory we
    are apt to refer to the "sturdy island race," meaning us. But
    that we are
<!-- Page 25 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page021" name="page021">[pg 21]</a>
    </span>

    insular in the full significance of the horrid word is certain.
    Why not? A genuine observation of the supreme phenomenon that
    Great Britain is surrounded by water&#8212;an effort to keep it
    always at the back of the consciousness&#8212;will help to
    explain all the minor phenomena of British existence.
    Geographical knowledge is the mother of discernment, for the
    varying physical characteristics of the earth are the sole
    direct terrestrial influence determining the evolution of
    original vital energy.</p>

    <p>All other influences are secondary, and have been effects of
    character and temperament before becoming causes. Perhaps the
    greatest of them are roads and architecture. Nothing could be
    more English than English roads, or more French than French
    roads. Enter England from France, let us say through the gate
    of Folkestone, and the architectural illustration which greets
    you (if you can look and see) is absolutely dramatic in its
    spectacular force. You say that there is no architecture in
    Folke

    stone. But Folkestone, like other towns, is just as full of
    architecture as a wood is full of trees. As the train winds on
    its causeway over the sloping town you perceive below you
    thousands of squat little homes, neat, tended, respectable,
    comfortable, prim, at once unostentatious and conceited. Each a
    separate, clearly-defined entity! Each saying to the others:
    "Don't look over my wall, and I won't look over yours!" Each
    with a ferocious jealousy bent on guarding its own
    individuality! Each a stronghold&#8212;an island! And all
    careless of the general effect, but making a very impressive
    general effect. The English race is below you. Your own son is
    below you insisting on the inviolability of his own den of a
    bedroom! ... And contrast all that with the immense communistic
    and splendid fa&#231;ades of a French town, and work out the
    implications. If you really intend to see life you cannot
    afford to be blind to such thrilling phenomena.</p>

    Yet an inexperienced, unguided curiosity would be capable of
    walking through a French street and through an English street,
    and noting chiefly that whereas English lamp-posts spring from
    the kerb, French lamp-posts cling to the side of the house! Not
    that that detail is not worth noting. It is&#8212;in its place.
    French lamp-posts are part of what we call the "interesting
    character" of a French street. We say of a French street that
    it is "full of character." As if an English street was not!
    Such is blindness&#8212;to be cured by travel and the exercise
    of the logical faculty, most properly termed common sense. If
    one is struck by the magnificence of the great towns of the
    Continent, one should ratiocinate, and conclude that a major
    characteristic of the great towns of England is their shabby
    and higgledy-piggledy slovenliness. It is so. But there are
    people who have lived fifty years in Manchester, Leeds, Hull
    and Hanley without noticing it. The English idiosyncrasy is in
    that
<!-- Page 28 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page024" name="page024">[pg 24]</a>
    </span>

    awful external slovenliness too, causing it, and being caused
    by it. Every street is a mirror, an illustration, an
    exposition, an explanation, of the human beings who live in it.
    Nothing in it is to be neglected. Everything in it is valuable,
    if the perspective is maintained. Nevertheless, in the narrow
    individualistic novels of English literature&#8212;and in some
    of the best&#8212;you will find a domestic organism described
    as though it existed in a vacuum, or in the Sahara, or between
    Heaven and earth; as though it reacted on nothing and was
    reacted on by nothing; and as though it could be adequately
    rendered without reference to anything exterior to itself. How
    can such novels satisfy a reader who has acquired or wants to
    acquire the faculty of seeing life?</p>

    <h3>V</h3>

    <p>The net result of the interplay of instincts and influences
    which determine the existence of a community is shown in the
    general expression on the faces of the people. This is an index
    which cannot lie and cannot be gainsaid. It is fairly easy, and
    extremely interesting, to decipher. It is so open, shameless,
    and universal, that not to look at it is impossible. Yet the
    majority of persons fail to see it. We hear of inquirers
    standing on London Bridge and counting the number of
    motor-buses, foot-passengers, lorries, and white horses that
    pass over the bridge in an hour. But we never hear of anybody
    counting the number of faces happy or unhappy, honest or
    rascally, shrewd or ingenuous, kind or cruel, that pass over
    the bridge. Perhaps the public may be surprised to hear that
    the general ex

    </span>

    pression on the faces of Londoners of all ranks varies from the
    sad to the morose; and that their general mien is one of haste
    and gloomy preoccupation. Such a staring fact is paramount in
    sociological evidence. And the observer of it would be
    justified in summoning Heaven, the legislature, the county
    council, the churches, and the ruling classes, and saying to
    them: "Glance at these faces, and don't boast too much about
    what you have accomplished. The climate and the industrial
    system have so far triumphed over you all."</p>

    <h3>VI</h3>

    <p>When we come to the observing of the individual&#8212;to
    which all human observing does finally come if there is any
    right reason in it&#8212;the aforesaid general considerations
    ought to be ever present in the hinterland of the
    consciousness, aiding and influencing, perhaps vaguely, perhaps
    almost imperceptibly, the formation of judgments. If they do
    nothing else, they will at any rate accustom the observer to
    the highly important idea of the correlation of all phenomena.
    Especially in England a haphazard particularity is the chief
    vitiating element in the operations of the mind.</p>

    <p>In estimating the individual we are apt not only to forget
    his environment, but&#8212;really strange!&#8212;to ignore much
    of the evidence visible in the individual himself. The
    inexperienced and ardent observer,
<!-- Page 32 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page028" name="page028">[pg 28]</a>
    </span>

    will, for example, be astonishingly blind to everything in an
    individual except his face. Telling himself that the face must
    be the reflection of the soul, and that every thought and
    emotion leaves inevitably its mark there, he will concentrate
    on the face, singling it out as a phenomenon apart and
    self-complete. Were he a god and infallible, he could no doubt
    learn the whole truth from the face. But he is bound to fall
    into errors, and by limiting the field of vision he minimises
    the opportunity for correction. The face is, after all, quite a
    small part of the individual's physical organism. An Englishman
    will look at a woman's face and say she is a beautiful woman or
    a plain woman. But a woman may have a plain face, and yet by
    her form be entitled to be called beautiful, and (perhaps)
    <i>vice vers&#226;</i>

    . It is true that the face is the reflexion of the soul. It is
    equally true that the carriage and gestures are the reflection
    of the soul. Had one eyes, the tying of a bootlace is the
    reflection of the
<!-- Page 33 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page029" name="page029">[pg 29]</a>
    </span>

    soul. One piece of evidence can be used to correct every other
    piece of evidence. A refined face may be refuted by clumsy
    finger-ends; the eyes may contradict the voice; the gait may
    nullify the smile. None of the phenomena which every individual
    carelessly and brazenly displays in every motor-bus terrorising
    the streets of London is meaningless or negligible.</p>

    <p>Again, in observing we are generally guilty of that
    particularity which results from sluggishness of the
    imagination. We may see the phenomenon at the moment of looking
    at it, but we particularise in that moment, making no effort to
    conceive what the phenomenon is likely to be at other
    moments.</p>

    <p>For example, a male human creature wakes up in the morning
    and rises with reluctance. Being a big man, and existing with
    his wife and children in a very confined space, he has to adapt
    himself to his environment as he goes through the various
    functions incident to preparing for his day's work. He is just
    like you
<!-- Page 34 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page030" name="page030">[pg 30]</a>
    </span>

    or me. He wants his breakfast, he very much wants to know where
    his boots are, and he has the usually sinister preoccupations
    about health and finance. Whatever the force of his egoism, he
    must more or less harmonise his individuality with those of his
    wife and children. Having laid down the law, or accepted it, he
    sets forth to his daily duties, just a fraction of a minute
    late. He arrives at his office, resumes life with his
    colleagues sympathetic and antipathetic, and then leaves the
    office for an expedition extending over several hours. In the
    course of his expedition he encounters the corpse of a young
    dog run down by a motor-bus. Now you also have encountered that
    corpse and are gazing at it; and what do you say to yourself
    when he comes along? You say: "Oh! Here's a policeman." For he
    happens to be a policeman. You stare at him, and you never see
    anything but a policeman&#8212;an indivisible phenomenon of
    blue cloth, steel buttons, flesh resembling a face, and a
    helmet; "
<!-- Page 35 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page031" name="page031">[pg 31]</a>
    </span>

    a stalwart guardian of the law"; to you little more human than
    an algebraic symbol: in a word&#8212;a policeman.</p>

    <p>Only, that word actually conveys almost nothing to you of
    the reality which it stands for. You are satisfied with it as
    you are satisfied with the description of a disease. A friend
    tells you his eyesight is failing. You sympathise. "What is
    it?" you ask. "Glaucoma." "Ah! Glaucoma!" You don't know what
    glaucoma is. You are no wiser than you were before. But you are
    content. A name has contented you. Similarly the name of
    policeman contents you, seems to absolve you from further
    curiosity as to the phenomenon. You have looked at tens of
    thousands of policemen, and perhaps never seen the hundredth
    part of the reality of a single one. Your imagination has not
    truly worked on the phenomenon.</p>

    <p>There may be some excuse for not seeing the reality of a
    policeman, because a uniform is always a thick veil. But you
    &#8212;

    I mean you, I, any of us&#8212;are oddly dim-sighted also in
    regard to the civil population. For instance, we get into the
    empty motor-bus as it leaves the scene of the street accident,
    and examine the men and women who gradually fill it. Probably
    we vaunt ourselves as being interested in the spectacle of
    life. All the persons in the motor-bus have come out of a past
    and are moving towards a future. But how often does our
    imagination put itself to the trouble of realising this? We may
    observe with some care, yet owing to a fundamental defect of
    attitude we are observing not the human individuals, but a
    peculiar race of beings who pass their whole lives in
    motor-buses, who exist only in motor-buses and only in the
    present! No human phenomenon is adequately seen until the
    imagination has placed it back into its past and forward into
    its future. And this is the final process of observation of the
    individual.</p>

    <h3>VII</h3>

    <p>Seeing life, as I have tried to show, does not begin with
    seeing the individual. Neither does it end with seeing the
    individual. Particular and unsystematised observation cannot go
    on for ever, aimless, formless. Just as individuals are singled
    out from systems, in the earlier process of observation, so in
    the later processes individuals will be formed into new groups,
    which formation will depend upon the personal bent of the
    observer. The predominant interests of the observer will
    ultimately direct his observing activities to their own
    advantage. If he is excited by the phenomena of
    organisation&#8212;as I happen to be&#8212;he will see
    individuals in new groups that are the result of organisation,
    and will insist on the variations from type due to that
    grouping. If he is convinced&#8212;as numbers of people appear
<!-- Page 38 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page034" name="page034">[pg 34]</a>
    </span>

    to be&#8212;that society is just now in an extremely critical
    pass, and that if something mysterious is not forthwith done
    the structure of it will crumble to atoms&#8212;he will see
    mankind grouped under the different reforms which, according to
    him, the human dilemma demands. And so on! These tendencies,
    while they should not be resisted too much, since they give
    character to observation and redeem it from the frigidity of
    mechanics, should be resisted to a certain extent. For,
    whatever they may be, they favour the growth of sentimentality,
    the protean and indescribably subtle enemy of common sense.</p>

    <p>The novelist is he who, having seen life, and being so
    excited by it that he absolutely must transmit the vision to
    others, chooses narrative fiction as the liveliest vehicle for
    the relief of his feelings. He is like other artists&#8212;he
    cannot remain silent; he cannot keep himself to himself, he is
    bursting with the news; he is bound to tell&#8212;the affair is
    too thrilling! Only he differs from most artists in
    this&#8212;that what most chiefly strikes him is the
    indefinable humanness of human nature, the large general manner
    of existing. Of course, he is the result of evolution from the
    primitive. And you can see primitive novelists to this day
    transmitting to acquaintances their fragmentary and crude
    visions of life in the caf&#233; or the club, or on the
    kerbstone. They belong to the lowest circle of artists;
<!-- Page 42 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page038" name="page038">[pg 38]</a>
    </span>

    but they are artists; and the form that they adopt is the very
    basis of the novel. By innumerable entertaining steps from them
    you may ascend to the major artist whose vision of life,
    inclusive, intricate and intense, requires for its due
    transmission the great traditional form of the novel as
    perfected by the masters of a long age which has temporarily
    set the novel higher than any other art-form.</p>

    <p>I would not argue that the novel should be counted supreme
    among the great traditional forms of art. Even if there is a
    greatest form, I do not much care which it is. I have in turn
    been convinced that Chartres Cathedral, certain Greek
    sculpture, Mozart's
    <i>Don Juan</i>

    , and the juggling of Paul Cinquevalli, was the finest thing in
    the world&#8212;not to mention the achievements of Shakspere or
    Nijinsky. But there is something to be said for the real
    pre-eminence of prose fiction as a literary form. (Even the
    modern epic has learnt almost all it knows from prose-fiction.)
    The novel has, and always will have, the
<!-- Page 43 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page039" name="page039">[pg 39]</a>
    </span>

    advantage of its comprehensive bigness. St Peter's at Rome is a
    trifle compared with Tolstoi's
    <i>War and Peace</i>

    ; and it is as certain as anything can be that, during the
    present geological epoch at any rate, no epic half as long as
    <i>War and Peace</i>

    will ever be read, even if written.</p>

    <p>Notoriously the novelist (including the playwright, who is a
    sub-novelist) has been taking the bread out of the mouths of
    other artists. In the matter of poaching, the painter has done
    a lot, and the composer has done more, but what the painter and
    the composer have done is as naught compared to the grasping
    deeds of the novelist. And whereas the painter and the composer
    have got into difficulties with their audacious schemes, the
    novelist has poached, colonised, and annexed with a success
    that is not denied. There is scarcely any aspect of the
    interestingness of life which is not now rendered in prose
    fiction&#8212;from landscape-painting to sociology&#8212;and
    none which might not be. Unnecessary to go back to the
    ante-Scott

    age in order to perceive how the novel has aggrandised itself!
    It has conquered enormous territories even since
    <i>Germinal</i>

    . Within the last fifteen years it has gained. Were it to adopt
    the hue of the British Empire, the entire map of the universe
    would soon be coloured red. Wherever it ought to stand in the
    hierarchy of forms, it has, actually, no rival at the present
    day as a means for transmitting the impassioned vision of life.
    It is, and will be for some time to come, the form to which the
    artist with the most inclusive vision instinctively turns,
    because it is the most inclusive form, and the most adaptable.
    Indeed, before we are much older, if its present rate of
    progress continues, it will have reoccupied the dazzling
    position to which the mighty Balzac lifted it, and in which he
    left it in 1850. So much, by the way, for the rank of the
    novel.</p>

    <h3>II</h3>

    <p>In considering the equipment of the novelist there are two
    attributes which may always be taken for granted. The first is
    the sense of beauty&#8212;indispensable to the creative artist.
    Every creative artist has it, in his degree. He is an artist
    because he has it. An artist works under the stress of
    instinct. No man's instinct can draw him towards material which
    repels him&#8212;the fact is obvious. Obviously, whatever kind
    of life the novelist writes about, he has been charmed and
    seduced by it, he is under its spell&#8212;that is, he has seen
    beauty in it. He could have no other reason for writing about
    it. He may see a strange sort of beauty; he may&#8212;indeed he
    does&#8212;see a sort of beauty that nobody has quite seen
    before; he may see a sort of beauty that none save a few odd
    spirits ever will or can be made
<!-- Page 46 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page042" name="page042">[pg 42]</a>
    </span>

    to see. But he does see beauty. To say, after reading a novel
    which has held you, that the author has no sense of beauty, is
    inept. (The mere fact that you turned over his pages with
    interest is an answer to the criticism&#8212;a criticism,
    indeed, which is not more sagacious than that of the reviewer
    who remarks: "Mr Blank has produced a thrilling novel, but
    unfortunately he cannot write." Mr Blank has written; and he
    could, anyhow, write enough to thrill the reviewer.) All that a
    wise person will assert is that an artist's sense of beauty is
    different for the time being from his own.</p>

    <p>The reproach of the lack of a sense of beauty has been
    brought against nearly all original novelists; it is seldom
    brought against a mediocre novelist. Even in the extreme cases
    it is untrue; perhaps it is most untrue in the extreme cases. I
    do not mean such a case as that of Zola, who never went to
    extremes. I mean, for example, Gissing, a real extremist, who,
    it is now admitted, saw a
<!-- Page 47 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page043" name="page043">[pg 43]</a>
    </span>

    clear and undiscovered beauty in forms of existence which
    hitherto no artist had deigned seriously to examine. And I mean
    Huysmans, a case even more extreme. Possibly no works have been
    more abused for ugliness than Huysman's novel
    <i>En M&#233;nage</i>

    and his book of descriptive essays
    <i>De Tout</i>

    . Both reproduce with exasperation what is generally regarded
    as the sordid ugliness of commonplace daily life. Yet both
    exercise a unique charm (and will surely be read when
    <i>La Cath&#233;drale</i>

    is forgotten). And it is inconceivable that
    Huysmans&#8212;whatever he may have said&#8212;was not ravished
    by the secret beauty of his subjects and did not exult in
    it.</p>

    <p>The other attribute which may be taken for granted in the
    novelist, as in every artist, is passionate intensity of
    vision. Unless the vision is passionately intense the artist
    will not be moved to transmit it. He will not be inconvenienced
    by it; and the motive to pass it on will thus not exist. Every
    fine emotion produced in
<!-- Page 48 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page044" name="page044">[pg 44]</a>
    </span>

    the reader has been, and must have been, previously felt by the
    writer, but in a far greater degree. It is not altogether
    uncommon to hear a reader whose heart has been desolated by the
    poignancy of a narrative complain that the writer is
    unemotional. Such people have no notion at all of the processes
    of artistic creation.</p>

    <h3>III</h3>

    <p>A sense of beauty and a passionate intensity of vision being
    taken for granted, the one other important attribute in the
    equipment of the novelist&#8212;the attribute which indeed by
    itself practically suffices, and whose absence renders futile
    all the rest&#8212;is fineness of mind. A great novelist must
    have great qualities of mind. His mind must be sympathetic,
    quickly responsive, courageous, honest, humorous, tender, just,
    merciful. He must be able to conceive the ideal without losing
    sight of the fact that it is a human world we live in. Above
    all, his mind must be permeated and controlled by common sense.
    His mind, in a word, must have the quality of being noble.
    Unless his mind is all this, he will never, at the ultimate
    bar, be reckoned supreme. That which counts, on every page, and

<!-- Page 50 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page046" name="page046">[pg 46]</a>
    </span>

    all the time, is the very texture of his mind&#8212;the glass
    through which he sees things. Every other attribute is
    secondary, and is dispensable. Fielding lives unequalled among
    English novelists because the broad nobility of his mind is
    unequalled. He is read with unreserved enthusiasm because the
    reader feels himself at each paragraph to be in close contact
    with a glorious personality. And no advance in technique among
    later novelists can possibly imperil his position. He will take
    second place when a more noble mind, a more superb common
    sense, happens to wield the narrative pen, and not before. What
    undermines the renown of Dickens is the growing conviction that
    the texture of his mind was common, that he fell short in
    courageous facing of the truth, and in certain delicacies of
    perception. As much may be said of Thackeray, whose mind was
    somewhat incomplete for so grandiose a figure, and not free
    from defects which are inimical to immortality.</p>

    <p>It is a hard saying for me, and full of
<!-- Page 51 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page047" name="page047">[pg 47]</a>
    </span>

    danger in any country whose artists have shown contempt for
    form, yet I am obliged to say that, as the years pass, I attach
    less and less importance to good technique in fiction. I love
    it, and I have fought for a better recognition of its
    importance in England, but I now have to admit that the modern
    history of fiction will not support me. With the single
    exception of Turgenev, the great novelists of the world,
    according to my own standards, have either ignored technique or
    have failed to understand it. What an error to suppose that the
    finest foreign novels show a better sense of form than the
    finest English novels! Balzac was a prodigious blunderer. He
    could not even manage a sentence, not to speak of the general
    form of a book. And as for a greater than
    Balzac&#8212;Stendhal&#8212;his scorn of technique was
    notorious. Stendhal was capable of writing, in a masterpiece:
    "By the way I ought to have told you earlier that the
    Duchess&#8212;!" And as for a greater
<!-- Page 52 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page048" name="page048">[pg 48]</a>
    </span>

    than either Balzac or Stendhal&#8212;Dostoievsky&#8212;what a
    hasty, amorphous lump of gold is the sublime, the
    unapproachable
    <i>Brothers Karamazov</i>

    ! Any tutor in a college for teaching the whole art of fiction
    by post in twelve lessons could show where Dostoievsky was
    clumsy and careless. What would have been Flaubert's detailed
    criticism of that book? And what would it matter? And, to take
    a minor example, witness the comically amateurish technique of
    the late "Mark Rutherford"&#8212;nevertheless a novelist whom
    one can deeply admire.</p>

    <p>And when we come to consider the great technicians, Guy de
    Maupassant and Flaubert, can we say that their technique will
    save them, or atone in the slightest degree for the defects of
    their minds? Exceptional artists both, they are both now
    inevitably falling in esteem to the level of the second-rate.
    Human nature being what it is, and de Maupassant being tinged
    with eroticism, his work is sure to be read with interest by
<!-- Page 53 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page049" name="page049">[pg 49]</a>
    </span>

    mankind; but he is already classed. Nobody, now, despite all
    his brilliant excellences, would dream of putting de Maupassant
    with the first magnitudes. And the declension of Flaubert is
    one of the outstanding phenomena of modern French criticism. It
    is being discovered that Flaubert's mind was not quite noble
    enough&#8212;that, indeed, it was a cruel mind, and a little
    an&#230;mic.
    <i>Bouvard et P&#233;cuchet</i>

    was the crowning proof that Flaubert had lost sight of the
    humanness of the world, and suffered from the delusion that he
    had been born on the wrong planet. The glitter of his technique
    is dulled now, and fools even count it against him. In regard
    to one section of human activity only did his mind seem
    noble&#8212;namely, literary technique. His correspondence,
    written, of course, currently, was largely occupied with the
    question of literary technique, and his correspondence stands
    forth to-day as his best work&#8212;a marvellous fount of
    inspiration to his fellow artists. So I
<!-- Page 54 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page050" name="page050">[pg 50]</a>
    </span>

    return to the point that the novelist's one important attribute
    (beyond the two postulated) is fundamental quality of mind. It
    and nothing else makes both the friends and the enemies which
    he has; while the influence of technique is slight and
    transitory. And I repeat that it is a hard saying.</p>

    <p>I begin to think that great writers of fiction are by the
    mysterious nature of their art ordained to be "amateurs." There
    may be something of the amateur in all great artists. I do not
    know why it should be so, unless because, in the exuberance of
    their sense of power, they are impatient of the exactitudes of
    systematic study and the mere bother of repeated attempts to
    arrive at a minor perfection. Assuredly no great artist was
    ever a profound scholar. The great artist has other ends to
    achieve. And every artist, major and minor, is aware in his
    conscience that art is full of artifice, and that the desire to
    proceed rapidly with the affair of creation, and an excus
<!-- Page 55 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page051" name="page051">[pg 51]</a>
    </span>

    able dislike of re-creating anything twice, thrice, or ten
    times over&#8212;unnatural task!&#8212;are responsible for much
    of that artifice. We can all point in excuse to Shakspere, who
    was a very rough-and-ready person, and whose methods would
    shock Flaubert. Indeed, the amateurishness of Shakspere has
    been mightily exposed of late years. But nobody seems to care.
    If Flaubert had been a greater artist he might have been more
    of an amateur.</p>

    <h3>IV</h3>

    <p>Of this poor neglected matter of technique the more
    important branch is design&#8212;or construction. It is the
    branch of the art&#8212;of all arts&#8212;which comes next
    after "inspiration"&#8212;a capacious word meant to include
    everything that the artist must be born with and cannot
    acquire. The less important branch of technique&#8212;far less
    important&#8212;may be described as an ornamentation.</p>

    <p>There are very few rules of design in the novel; but the few
    are capital. Nevertheless, great novelists have often flouted
    or ignored them&#8212;to the detriment of their work. In my
    opinion the first rule is that the interest must be
    centralised; it must not be diffused equally over various parts
    of the canvas. To compare one art with another may be perilous,
    but really the convenience of
<!-- Page 57 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page053" name="page053">[pg 53]</a>
    </span>

    describing a novel as a canvas is extreme. In a well-designed
    picture the eye is drawn chiefly to one particular spot. If the
    eye is drawn with equal force to several different spots, then
    we reproach the painter for having "scattered" the interest of
    the picture. Similarly with the novel. A novel must have one,
    two, or three figures that easily overtop the rest. These
    figures must be in the foreground, and the rest in the
    middle-distance or in the back-ground.</p>

    <p>Moreover, these figures&#8212;whether they are saints or
    sinners&#8212;must somehow be presented more sympathetically
    than the others. If this cannot be done, then the inspiration
    is at fault. The single motive that should govern the choice of
    a principal figure is the motive of love for that figure. What
    else could the motive be? The race of heroes is essential to
    art. But what makes a hero is less the deeds of the figure
    chosen than the understanding sympathy of the artist with the
    figure. To say that the hero has disappeared from
<!-- Page 58 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page054" name="page054">[pg 54]</a>
    </span>

    modern fiction is absurd. All that has happened is that the
    characteristics of the hero have changed, naturally, with the
    times. When Thackeray wrote "a novel without a hero," he wrote
    a novel with a first-class hero, and nobody knew this better
    than Thackeray. What he meant was that he was sick of the
    conventional bundle of characteristics styled a hero in his
    day, and that he had changed the type. Since then we have grown
    sick of Dobbins, and the type has been changed again more than
    once. The fateful hour will arrive when we shall be sick of
    Ponderevos.</p>

    <p>The temptation of the great novelist, overflowing with
    creative force, is to scatter the interest. In both his major
    works Tolstoi found the temptation too strong for him.
    <i>Anna Karenina</i>

    is not one novel, but two, and suffers accordingly. As for
    <i>War and Peace</i>

    , the reader wanders about in it as in a forest, for days,
    lost, deprived of a sense of direction, and with no vestige of
    a sign-post; at
<!-- Page 59 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page055" name="page055">[pg 55]</a>
    </span>

    intervals encountering mysterious faces whose identity he in
    vain tries to recall. On a much smaller scale Meredith
    committed the same error. Who could assert positively which of
    the sisters Fleming is the heroine of
    <i>Rhoda Fleming</i>

    ? For nearly two hundred pages at a stretch Rhoda scarcely
    appears. And more than once the author seems quite to forget
    that the little knave Algernon is not, after all, the hero of
    the story.</p>

    <p>The second rule of design&#8212;perhaps in the main merely a
    different view of the first&#8212;is that the interest must be
    maintained. It may increase, but it must never diminish. Here
    is that special aspect of design which we call construction, or
    plot. By interest I mean the interest of the story itself, and
    not the interest of the continual play of the author's mind on
    his material. In proportion as the interest of the story is
    maintained, the plot is a good one. In so far as it lapses, the
    plot is a bad one. There is no other criterion of good con
<!-- Page 60 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page056" name="page056">[pg 56]</a>
    </span>

    struction. Readers of a certain class are apt to call good the
    plot of that story in which "you can't tell what is going to
    happen next." But in some of the most tedious novels ever
    written you can't tell what is going to happen next&#8212;and
    you don't care a fig what is going to happen next. It would be
    nearer the mark to say that the plot is good when "you want to
    make sure what will happen next"! Good plots set you anxiously
    guessing what will happen next.</p>

    <p>When the reader is misled&#8212;not intentionally in order
    to get an effect, but clumsily through
    amateurishness&#8212;then the construction is bad. This
    calamity does not often occur in fine novels, but in really
    good work another calamity does occur with far too much
    frequency&#8212;namely, the tantalising of the reader at a
    critical point by a purposeless, wanton, or negligent shifting
    of the interest from the major to the minor theme. A sad
    example of this infantile trick is to be found in the
    thirty-first chapter of
    <i>Rhoda</i>

<!-- Page 61 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page057" name="page057">[pg 57]</a>
    </span>

    <i>Fleming</i>

    , wherein, well knowing that the reader is tingling for the
    interview between Roberts and Rhoda, the author, unable to
    control his own capricious and monstrous fancy for Algernon,
    devotes some sixteen pages to the young knave's vagaries with
    an illicit thousand pounds. That the sixteen pages are
    excessively brilliant does not a bit excuse the wilful
    unshapeliness of the book's design.</p>

    <p>The Edwardian and Georgian out-and-out defenders of
    Victorian fiction are wont to argue that though the event-plot
    in sundry great novels may be loose and casual (that is to say,
    simply careless), the "idea-plot" is usually close-knit,
    coherent, and logical. I have never yet been able to comprehend
    how an idea-plot can exist independently of an event-plot (any
    more than how spirit can be conceived apart from matter); but
    assuming that an idea-plot can exist independently, and that
    the mysterious thing is superior in form to its coarse fellow,
    the event-plot (which I positively
<!-- Page 62 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page058" name="page058">[pg 58]</a>
    </span>

    do not believe),&#8212;even then I still hold that sloppiness
    in the fabrication of the event-plot amounts to a grave
    iniquity. In this connection I have in mind, among English
    novels, chiefly the work of "Mark Rutherford," George Eliot,
    the Bront&#235;s, and Anthony Trollope.</p>

    <p>The one other important rule in construction is that the
    plot should be kept throughout within the same convention. All
    plots&#8212;even those of our most sacred naturalistic
    contemporaries&#8212;are and must be a conventionalisation of
    life. We imagine we have arrived at a convention which is
    nearer to the truth of life than that of our forerunners.
    Perhaps we have&#8212;but so little nearer that the difference
    is scarcely appreciable! An aviator at midday may be nearer the
    sun than the motorist, but regarded as a portion of the entire
    journey to the sun, the aviator's progress upward can safely be
    ignored. No novelist has yet, or ever will, come within a
    hundred million miles of life itself. It is impossible for us
    to
<!-- Page 63 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page059" name="page059">[pg 59]</a>
    </span>

    see how far we still are from life. The defects of a new
    convention disclose themselves late in its career. The notion
    that "naturalists" have at last lighted on a final formula
    which ensures truth to life is ridiculous. "Naturalist" is
    merely an epithet expressing self-satisfaction.</p>

    <p>Similarly, the habit of deriding as "conventional" plots
    constructed in an earlier convention, is ridiculous. Under this
    head Dickens in particular has been assaulted; I have assaulted
    him myself. But within their convention, the plots of Dickens
    are excellent, and show little trace of amateurishness, and
    every sign of skilled accomplishment. And Dickens did not
    blunder out of one convention into another, as certain of
    ourselves undeniably do. Thomas Hardy, too, has been arraigned
    for the conventionalism of his plots. And yet Hardy happens to
    be one of the rare novelists who have evolved a new convention
    to suit their idiosyncrasy. Hardy's idiosyncrasy is a
<!-- Page 64 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page060" name="page060">[pg 60]</a>
    </span>

    deep conviction of the whimsicality of the divine power, and
    again and again he has expressed this with a virtuosity of
    skill which ought to have put humility into the hearts of
    naturalists, but which has not done so. The plot of
    <i>The Woodlanders</i>

    is one of the most exquisite examples of subtle symbolic
    illustration of an idea that a writer of fiction ever achieved;
    it makes the symbolism of Ibsen seem crude. You may say that
    <i>The Woodlanders</i>

    could not have occurred in real life. No novel could have
    occurred in real life. The balance of probabilities is
    incalculably against any novel whatsoever; and rightly so. A
    convention is essential, and the duty of a novelist is to be
    true within his chosen convention, and not further. Most
    novelists still fail in this duty. Is there any reason, indeed,
    why we should be so vastly cleverer than our fathers? I do not
    think we are.</p>

    <h3>V</h3>

    <p>Leaving the seductive minor question of ornamentation, I
    come lastly to the question of getting the semblance of life on
    to the page before the eyes of the reader&#8212;the daily and
    hourly texture of existence. The novelist has selected his
    subject; he has drenched himself in his subject. He has laid
    down the main features of the design. The living embryo is
    there, and waits to be developed into full organic structure.
    Whence and how does the novelist obtain the vital tissue which
    must be his material? The answer is that he digs it out of
    himself. First-class fiction is, and must be, in the final
    resort autobiographical. What else should it be? The novelist
    may take notes of phenomena likely to be of use to him. And he
    may acquire the skill to invent very apposite illustrative inci

    dent. But he cannot invent psychology. Upon occasion some human
    being may entrust him with confidences extremely precious for
    his craft. But such windfalls are so rare as to be negligible.
    From outward symptoms he can guess something of the psychology
    of others. He can use a real person as the unrecognisable but
    helpful basis for each of his characters.... And all that is
    nothing. And all special research is nothing. When the real
    intimate work of creation has to be done&#8212;and it has to be
    done on every page&#8212;the novelist can only look within for
    effective aid. Almost solely by arranging and modifying what he
    has felt and seen, and scarcely at all by inventing, can he
    accomplish his end. An inquiry into the career of any
    first-class novelist invariably reveals that his novels are
    full of autobiography. But, as a fact, every good novel
    contains far more autobiography than any inquiry could reveal.
    Episodes, moods, characters of autobiography can be detected
    and traced

    <span class="pagenum">

    </span>

    to their origin by critical acumen, but the intimate
    autobiography that runs through each page, vitalising it, may
    not be detected. In dealing with each character in each episode
    the novelist must for a thousand convincing details interrogate
    that part of his own individuality which corresponds to the
    particular character. The foundation of his equipment is
    universal sympathy. And the result of this (or the
    cause&#8212;I don't know which) is that in his own
    individuality there is something of everybody. If he is a born
    novelist he is safe in asking himself, when in doubt as to the
    behaviour of a given personage at a given point: "Now, what
    should
    <i>I</i>

    have done?" And incorporating the answer! And this in practice
    is what he does. Good fiction is autobiography dressed in the
    colours of all mankind.</p>

    <p>The necessarily autobiographical nature of fiction accounts
    for the creative repetition to which all
    novelists&#8212;including the most powerful&#8212;are reduced.
    They
<!-- Page 68 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page064" name="page064">[pg 64]</a>
    </span>

    monotonously yield again and again to the strongest
    predilections of their own individuality. Again and again they
    think they are creating, by observation, a quite new
    character&#8212;and lo! when finished it is an old
    one&#8212;autobiographical psychology has triumphed! A novelist
    may achieve a reputation with only a single type, created and
    re-created in varying forms. And the very greatest do not
    contrive to create more than half a score genuine separate
    types. In Cerfberr and Christophe's biographical dictionary of
    the characters of Balzac, a tall volume of six hundred pages,
    there are some two thousand entries of different individuals,
    but probably fewer than a dozen genuine distinctive types. No
    creative artist ever repeated himself more brazenly or more
    successfully than Balzac. His miser, his vicious delightful
    actress, his vicious delightful duchess, his young
    man-about-town, his virtuous young man, his heroic weeping
    virgin, his angelic wife and mother, his poor relation, and his

    faithful stupid servant&#8212;each is continually popping up
    with a new name in the Human Comedy. A similar phenomenon, as
    Frank Harris has proved, is to be observed in Shakspere. Hamlet
    of Denmark was only the last and greatest of a series of
    Shaksperean Hamlets.</p>

    <p>It may be asked, finally: What of the actual process of
    handling the raw material dug out of existence and of the
    artist's self&#8212;the process of transmuting life into art?
    There is no process. That is to say, there is no conscious
    process. The convention chosen by an artist is his illusion of
    the truth. Consciously, the artist only omits, selects,
    arranges. But let him beware of being false to his illusion,
    for then the process becomes conscious, and bad. This is
    sentimentality, which is the seed of death in his work. Every
    artist is tempted to sentimentalise, or to be
    cynical&#8212;practically the same thing. And when he falls to
    the temptation, the reader whispers in his heart, be it only
    for one instant: "That
<!-- Page 70 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page066" name="page066">[pg 66]</a>
    </span>

    is not true to life." And in turn the reader's illusion of
    reality is impaired. Readers are divided into two
    classes&#8212;the enemies and the friends of the artist. The
    former, a legion, admire for a fortnight or a year. They hate
    an uncompromising struggle for the truth. They positively like
    the artist to fall to temptation. If he falls, they exclaim,
    "How sweet!" The latter are capable of savouring the fine
    unpleasantness of the struggle for truth. And when they whisper
    in their hearts: "That is not true to life," they are ashamed
    for the artist. They are few, very few; but a vigorous clan. It
    is they who confer immortality.</p>

    <h3>I</h3>

    <p>There is an idea abroad, assiduously fostered as a rule by
    critics who happen to have written neither novels nor plays,
    that it is more difficult to write a play than a novel. I do
    not think so. I have written or collaborated in about twenty
    novels and about twenty plays, and I am convinced that it is
    easier to write a play than a novel. Personally, I would sooner

    <i>write</i>

    two plays than one novel; less expenditure of nervous force and
    mere brains would be required for two plays than for one novel.
    (I emphasise the word "write," because if the whole weariness
    between the first conception and the first performance of a
    play is compared with the whole weariness between the first
    conception and the first publication of a novel, then the play
    has it. I would sooner get seventy-and-seven novels produced
    than one play. But my

    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page070" name="page070">[pg 70]</a>
    </span>

    immediate object is to compare only writing with writing.) It
    seems to me that the sole persons entitled to judge of the
    comparative difficulty of writing plays and writing novels are
    those authors who have succeeded or failed equally well in both
    departments. And in this limited band I imagine that the
    differences of opinion on the point could not be marked. I
    would like to note in passing, for the support of my
    proposition, that whereas established novelists not
    infrequently venture into the theatre with audacity,
    established dramatists are very cautious indeed about quitting
    the theatre. An established dramatist usually takes good care
    to write plays and naught else; he will not affront the risks
    of coming out into the open; and therein his instinct is quite
    properly that of self-preservation. Of many established
    dramatists all over the world it may be affirmed that if they
    were so indiscreet as to publish a novel, the result would be a
    great shattering and a great awakening.</p>

    <h3>II</h3>

    <p>An enormous amount of vague reverential nonsense is talked
    about the technique of the stage, the assumption being that in
    difficulty it far surpasses any other literary technique, and
    that until it is acquired a respectable play cannot be written.
    One hears also that it can only be acquired behind the scenes.
    A famous actor-manager once kindly gave me the benefit of his
    experience, and what he said was that a dramatist who wished to
    learn his business must live behind the scenes&#8212;and study
    the works of Dion Boucicault! The truth is that no technique is
    so crude and so simple as the technique of the stage, and that
    the proper place to learn it is not behind the scenes but in
    the pit. Managers, being the most conservative people on earth,
    except compositors, will honestly try to
<!-- Page 76 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page072" name="page072">[pg 72]</a>
    </span>

    convince the na&#239;ve dramatist that effects can only be
    obtained in the precise way in which effects have always been
    obtained, and that this and that rule must not be broken on
    pain of outraging the public.</p>

    <p>And indeed it is natural that managers should talk thus,
    seeing the low state of the drama, because in any art rules and
    reaction always flourish when creative energy is sick. The
    mandarins have ever said and will ever say that a technique
    which does not correspond with their own is no technique, but
    simple clumsiness. There are some seven situations in the
    customary drama, and a play which does not contain at least one
    of those situations in each act will be condemned as
    "undramatic," or "thin," or as being "all talk." It may contain
    half a hundred other situations, but for the mandarin a
    situation which is not one of the seven is not a situation.
    Similarly there are some dozen character types in the customary
    drama, and all original
<!-- Page 77 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page073" name="page073">[pg 73]</a>
    </span>

    that is, truthful&#8212;characterisation will be dismissed as a
    total absence of characterisation because it does not reproduce
    any of these dozen types. Thus every truly original play is
    bound to be indicted for bad technique. The author is bound to
    be told that what he has written may be marvellously clever,
    but that it is not a play. I remember the day&#8212;and it is
    not long ago&#8212;when even so experienced and sincere a
    critic as William Archer used to argue that if the
    "intellectual" drama did not succeed with the general public,
    it was because its technique was not up to the level of the
    technique of the commercial drama! Perhaps he has changed his
    opinion since then. Heaven knows that the so-called
    "intellectual" drama is amateurish enough, but nearly all
    literary art is amateurish, and assuredly no intellectual drama
    could hope to compete in clumsiness with some of the most
    successful commercial plays of modern times. I tremble to think
    what the mandarins and William Archer would
<!-- Page 78 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page074" name="page074">[pg 74]</a>
    </span>

    say to the technique of
    <i>Hamlet</i>

    , could it by some miracle be brought forward as a new piece by
    a Mr Shakspere. They would probably recommend Mr Shakspere to
    consider the ways of Sardou, Henri Bernstein, and Sir Herbert
    Tree, and be wise. Most positively they would assert that
    <i>Hamlet</i>

    was not a play. And their pupils of the daily press would point
    out&#8212;what surely Mr Shakspere ought to have perceived for
    himself&#8212;that the second, third, or fourth act might be
    cut wholesale without the slightest loss to the piece.</p>

    <p>In the sense in which mandarins understand the word
    technique, there is no technique special to the stage except
    that which concerns the moving of solid human bodies to and
    fro, and the limitations of the human senses. The dramatist
    must not expect his audience to be able to see or hear two
    things at once, nor to be incapable of fatigue. And he must not
    expect his interpreters to stroll round or come on or go off in
    a satisfactory manner unless he provides
<!-- Page 79 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page075" name="page075">[pg 75]</a>
    </span>

    them with satisfactory reasons for strolling round, coming on,
    or going off. Lastly, he must not expect his interpreters to
    achieve physical impossibilities. The dramatist who sends a
    pretty woman off in street attire and seeks to bring her on
    again in thirty seconds fully dressed for a court ball may fail
    in stage technique, but he has not proved that stage technique
    is tremendously difficult; he has proved something quite
    else.</p>

    <h3>III</h3>

    <p>One reason why a play is easier to write than a novel is
    that a play is shorter than a novel. On the average, one may
    say that it takes six plays to make the matter of a novel.
    Other things being equal, a short work of art presents fewer
    difficulties than a longer one. The contrary is held true by
    the majority, but then the majority, having never attempted to
    produce a long work of art, are unqualified to offer an
    opinion. It is said that the most difficult form of poetry is
    the sonnet. But the most difficult form of poetry is the epic.
    The proof that the sonnet is the most difficult form is alleged
    to be in the fewness of perfect sonnets. There are, however,
    far more perfect sonnets than perfect epics. A perfect sonnet
    may be a heavenly accident. But such accidents can never happen
    to writers of
<!-- Page 81 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page077" name="page077">[pg 77]</a>
    </span>

    epics. Some years ago we had an enormous palaver about the "art
    of the short story," which numerous persons who had omitted to
    write novels pronounced to be more difficult than the novel.
    But the fact remains that there are scores of perfect short
    stories, whereas it is doubtful whether anybody but Turgenev
    ever did write a perfect novel. A short form is easier to
    manipulate than a long form, because its construction is less
    complicated, because the balance of its proportions can be more
    easily corrected by means of a rapid survey, because it is
    lawful and even necessary in it to leave undone many things
    which are very hard to do, and because the emotional strain is
    less prolonged. The most difficult thing in all art is to
    maintain the imaginative tension unslackened throughout a
    considerable period.</p>

    <p>Then, not only does a play contain less matter than a
    novel&#8212;it is further simplified by the fact that it
    contains fewer kinds of matter, and less subtle kinds of
<!-- Page 82 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page078" name="page078">[pg 78]</a>
    </span>

    matter. There are numerous delicate and difficult affairs of
    craft that the dramatist need not think about at all. If he
    attempts to go beyond a certain very mild degree of subtlety,
    he is merely wasting his time. What passes for subtle on the
    stage would have a very obvious air in a novel, as some
    dramatists have unhappily discovered. Thus whole continents of
    danger may be shunned by the dramatist, and instead of being
    scorned for his cowardice he will be very rightly applauded for
    his artistic discretion. Fortunate predicament! Again, he need
    not&#8212;indeed, he must not&#8212;save in a primitive and
    hinting manner, concern himself with "atmosphere." He may
    roughly suggest one, but if he begins on the feat of "creating"
    an atmosphere (as it is called), the last suburban train will
    have departed before he has reached the crisis of the play. The
    last suburban train is the best friend of the dramatist, though
    the fellow seldom has the sense to see it. Further, he is saved
    all de

    <span class="pagenum">

    </span>

    scriptive work. See a novelist harassing himself into his grave
    over the description of a landscape, a room, a
    gesture&#8212;while the dramatist grins. The dramatist may have
    to imagine a landscape, a room, or a gesture; but he has not
    got to write it&#8212;and it is the writing which hastens
    death. If a dramatist and a novelist set out to portray a
    clever woman, they are almost equally matched, because each has
    to make the creature say things and do things. But if they set
    out to portray a charming woman, the dramatist can recline in
    an easy chair and smoke while the novelist is ruining temper,
    digestion and eyesight, and spreading terror in his household
    by his moodiness and unapproachability. The electric light
    burns in the novelist's study at three a.m.,&#8212;the novelist
    is still endeavouring to convey by means of words the
    extraordinary fascination that his heroine could exercise over
    mankind by the mere act of walking into a room; and he never
    has really succeeded and never will. The dramatist
<!-- Page 84 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page080" name="page080">[pg 80]</a>
    </span>

    writes curtly, "Enter Millicent." All are anxious to do the
    dramatist's job for him. Is the play being read at
    home&#8212;the reader eagerly and with brilliant success puts
    his imagination to work and completes a charming Millicent
    after his own secret desires. (Whereas he would coldly decline
    to add one touch to Millicent were she the heroine of a novel.)
    Is the play being performed on the stage&#8212;an experienced,
    conscientious, and perhaps lovely actress will strive her
    hardest to prove that the dramatist was right about Millicent's
    astounding fascination. And if she fails, nobody will blame the
    dramatist; the dramatist will receive naught but sympathy.</p>

    <p>And there is still another region of superlative difficulty
    which is narrowly circumscribed for the spoilt dramatist: I
    mean the whole business of persuading the public that the
    improbable is probable. Every work of art is and must be
    crammed with improbabilities and artifice; and the greater
    portion of the artifice is employed
<!-- Page 85 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page081" name="page081">[pg 81]</a>
    </span>

    in just this trickery of persuasion. Only, the public of the
    dramatist needs far less persuading than the public of the
    novelist. The novelist announces that Millicent accepted the
    hand of the wrong man, and in spite of all the novelist's
    corroborative and exegetical detail the insulted reader
    declines to credit the statement and condemns the incident as
    unconvincing. The dramatist decides that Millicent must accept
    the hand of the wrong man, and there she is on the stage in
    flesh and blood, veritably doing it! Not easy for even the
    critical beholder to maintain that Millicent could not and did
    not do such a silly thing when he has actually with his eyes
    seen her in the very act! The dramatist, as usual, having done
    less, is more richly rewarded by results.</p>

    <p>Of course it will be argued, as it has always been argued,
    by those who have not written novels, that it is precisely the
    "doing less"&#8212;the leaving out&#8212;that constitutes the
    unique and fearful difficulty of dramatic art. "The
<!-- Page 86 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page082" name="page082">[pg 82]</a>
    </span>

    skill to leave out"&#8212;lo! the master faculty of the
    dramatist! But, in the first place, I do not believe that,
    having regard to the relative scope of the play and of the
    novel, the necessity for leaving out is more acute in the one
    than in the other. The adjective "photographic" is as absurd
    applied to the novel as to the play. And, in the second place,
    other factors being equal, it is less exhausting, and it
    requires less skill, to refrain from doing than to do. To know
    when to refrain from doing may be hard, but positively to do is
    even harder. Sometimes, listening to partisans of the drama, I
    have been moved to suggest that, if the art of omission is so
    wondrously difficult, a dramatist who practised the habit of
    omitting to write anything whatever ought to be hailed as the
    supreme craftsman.</p>

    <hr />

    <h3>IV</h3>

    <p>The more closely one examines the subject, the more clear
    and certain becomes the fact that there is only one fundamental
    artistic difference between the novel and the play, and that
    difference (to which I shall come later) is not the difference
    which would be generally named as distinguishing the play from
    the novel. The apparent differences are superficial, and are
    due chiefly to considerations of convenience.</p>

    <p>Whether in a play or in a novel the creative artist has to
    tell a story&#8212;using the word story in a very wide sense.
    Just as a novel is divided into chapters, and for a similar
    reason, a play is divided into acts. But neither chapters nor
    acts are necessary. Some of Balzac's chief novels have no
    chapter-divisions, and it has been proved that a theatre
    audience
<!-- Page 88 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page084" name="page084">[pg 84]</a>
    </span>

    can and will listen for two hours to "talk," and even
    recitative singing, on the stage, without a pause. Indeed,
    audiences, under the compulsion of an artist strong and
    imperious enough, could, I am sure, be trained to marvellous
    feats of prolonged receptivity. However, chapters and acts are
    usual, and they involve the same constructional processes on
    the part of the artist. The entire play or novel must tell a
    complete story&#8212;that is, arouse a curiosity and reasonably
    satisfy it, raise a main question and then settle it. And each
    act or other chief division must tell a definite portion of the
    story, satisfy part of the curiosity, settle part of the
    question. And each scene or other minor division must do the
    same according to its scale. Everything basic that applies to
    the technique of the novel applies equally to the technique of
    the play.</p>

    <p>In particular, I would urge that a play, any more than a
    novel, need not be dramatic, employing the term as it is
<!-- Page 89 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page085" name="page085">[pg 85]</a>
    </span>

    usually employed. In so far as it suspends the listener's
    interest, every tale, however told, may be said to be dramatic.
    In this sense
    <i>The Golden Bowl</i>

    is dramatic; so are
    <i>Dominique</i>

    and
    <i>Persuasion</i>

    . A play need not be more dramatic than that. Very emphatically
    a play need not be dramatic in the stage sense. It need never
    induce interest to the degree of excitement. It need have
    nothing that resembles what would be recognisable in the
    theatre as a situation. It may amble on&#8212;and it will still
    be a play, and it may succeed in pleasing either the fastidious
    hundreds or the unfastidious hundreds of thousands, according
    to the talent of the author. Without doubt mandarins will
    continue for about a century yet to excommunicate certain plays
    from the category of plays. But nobody will be any the worse.
    And dramatists will go on proving that whatever else divides a
    play from a book, "dramatic quality" does not. Some
    arch-Mandarin may launch at me one of those mandarinic epigram
<!-- Page 90 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page086" name="page086">[pg 86]</a>
    </span>

    matic questions which are supposed to overthrow the adversary
    at one dart. "Do you seriously mean to argue, sir, that drama
    need not be dramatic?" I do, if the word dramatic is to be used
    in the mandarinic signification. I mean to state that some of
    the finest plays of the modern age differ from a psychological
    novel in nothing but the superficial form of telling. Example,
    Henri Becque's
    <i>La Parisienne</i>

    , than which there is no better. If I am asked to give my own
    definition of the adjective "dramatic," I would say that that
    story is dramatic which is told in dialogue imagined to be
    spoken by actors and actresses on the stage, and that any
    narrower definition is bound to exclude some genuine plays
    universally accepted as such&#8212;even by mandarins. For be it
    noted that the mandarin is never consistent.</p>

    <p>My definition brings me to the sole technical difference
    between a play and a novel&#8212;in the play the story is told
    by means of a dialogue. It is a difference
<!-- Page 91 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page087" name="page087">[pg 87]</a>
    </span>

    less important than it seems, and not invariably even a sure
    point of distinction between the two kinds of narrative. For a
    novel may consist exclusively of dialogue. And plays may
    contain other matter than dialogue. The classic chorus is not
    dialogue. But nowadays we should consider the device of the
    chorus to be clumsy, as, nowadays, it indeed would be. We have
    grown very ingenious and clever at the trickery of making
    characters talk to the audience and explain themselves and
    their past history while seemingly innocent of any such
    intention. And here, I admit, the dramatist has to face a
    difficulty special to himself, which the novelist can avoid. I
    believe it to be the sole difficulty which is peculiar to the
    drama, and that it is not acute is proved by the ease with
    which third-rate dramatists have generally vanquished it.
    Mandarins are wont to assert that the dramatist is also
    handicapped by the necessity for rigid economy in the use of
    material. This is not so. Rigid economy
<!-- Page 92 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page088" name="page088">[pg 88]</a>
    </span>

    in the use of material is equally advisable in every form of
    art. If it is a necessity, it is a necessity which all artists
    flout from time to time, and occasionally with gorgeous
    results, and the successful dramatist has hitherto not been
    less guilty of flouting it than the novelist or any other
    artist.</p>

    <p>And now, having shown that some alleged differences between
    the play and the novel are illusory, and that a certain
    technical difference, though possibly real, is superficial and
    slight, I come to the fundamental difference between
    them&#8212;a difference which the laity does not suspect, which
    is seldom insisted upon and never sufficiently, but which
    nobody who is well versed in the making of both plays and
    novels can fail to feel profoundly. The emotional strain of
    writing a play is not merely less prolonged than that of
    writing a novel, it is less severe even while it lasts, lower
    in degree and of a less purely creative character. And herein
    is the chief of all the reasons why a play is easier to write
    than a novel. The drama does not belong exclusively to
    literature, because its effect
<!-- Page 94 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page090" name="page090">[pg 90]</a>
    </span>

    depends on something more than the composition of words. The
    dramatist is the sole author of a play, but he is not the sole
    creator of it. Without him nothing can be done, but, on the
    other hand, he cannot do everything himself. He begins the work
    of creation, which is finished either by creative interpreters
    on the stage, or by the creative imagination of the reader in
    the study. It is as if he carried an immense weight to the
    landing at the turn of a flight of stairs, and that thence
    upward the lifting had to be done by other people. Consider the
    affair as a pyramidal structure, and the dramatist is the
    base&#8212;but he is not the apex. A play is a collaboration of
    creative faculties. The egotism of the dramatist resents this
    uncomfortable fact, but the fact exists. And further, the
    creative faculties are not only those of the author, the
    stage-director ("producer") and the actors&#8212;the audience
    itself is unconsciously part of the collaboration.</p>

    <p>
<!-- Page 95 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page091" name="page091">[pg 91]</a>
    </span>

    Hence a dramatist who attempts to do the whole work of creation
    before the acting begins is an inartistic usurper of the
    functions of others, and will fail of proper accomplishment at
    the end. The dramatist must deliberately, in performing his
    share of the work, leave scope for a multitude of alien
    faculties whose operations he can neither precisely foresee nor
    completely control. The point is not that in the writing of a
    play there are various sorts of matters&#8212;as we have
    already seen&#8212;-which the dramatist must ignore; the point
    is that even in the region proper to him he must not push the
    creative act to its final limit. He must ever remember those
    who are to come after him. For instance, though he must
    visualise a scene as he writes it, he should not visualise it
    completely, as a novelist should. The novelist may perceive
    vividly the faces of his personages, but if the playwright
    insists on seeing faces, either he will see the faces of real
    actors and hamper himself by moulding the scene to suit such
<!-- Page 96 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page092" name="page092">[pg 92]</a>
    </span>

    real actors, or he will perceive imaginary faces, and the
    ultimate interpretation will perforce falsify his work and
    nullify his intentions. This aspect of the subject might well
    be much amplified, but only for a public of practising
    dramatists.</p>

    <h3>VI</h3>

    <p>When the play is "finished," the processes of collaboration
    have yet to begin. The serious work of the dramatist is over,
    but the most desolating part of his toil awaits him. I do not
    refer to the business of arranging with a theatrical manager
    for the production of the play. For, though that generally
    partakes of the nature of tragedy, it also partakes of the
    nature of amusing burlesque, owing to the fact that theatrical
    managers are&#8212;no doubt inevitably&#8212;theatrical.
    Nevertheless, even the theatrical manager, while disclaiming
    the slightest interest in anything more vital to the stage than
    the box-office, is himself in some degree a collaborator, and
    is the first to show to the dramatist that a play is not a play
    till it is performed. The manager reads the play, and, to the
    dramatist's astonishment,
<!-- Page 98 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page094" name="page094">[pg 94]</a>
    </span>

    reads quite a different play from that which the dramatist
    imagines he wrote. In particular the manager reads a play which
    can scarcely hope to succeed&#8212;indeed, a play against whose
    chances of success ten thousand powerful reasons can be
    adduced. It is remarkable that a manager nearly always foresees
    failure in a manuscript, and very seldom success. The manager's
    profoundest instinct&#8212;self-preservation again!&#8212;is to
    refuse a play; if he accepts, it is against the grain, against
    his judgment&#8212;and out of a mad spirit of adventure. Some
    of the most glittering successes have been rehearsed in an
    atmosphere of settled despair. The dramatist naturally feels an
    immense contempt for the opinions artistic and otherwise of the
    manager, and he is therein justified. The manager's vocation is
    not to write plays, nor (let us hope) to act in them, nor to
    direct the rehearsals of them, and even his knowledge of the
    vagaries of his own box-office has often proved to be pitiably
    delusive. The
<!-- Page 99 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page095" name="page095">[pg 95]</a>
    </span>

    manager's true and only vocation is to refrain from producing
    plays. Despite all this, however, the manager has already
    collaborated in the play. The dramatist sees it differently
    now. All sorts of new considerations have been presented to
    him. Not a word has been altered; but it is noticeably another
    play. Which is merely to say that the creative work on it which
    still remains to be done has been more accurately envisaged.
    This strange experience could not happen to a novel, because
    when a novel is written it is finished.</p>

    <p>And when the director of rehearsals, or producer, has been
    chosen, and this priceless and mysterious person has his first
    serious confabulation with the author, then at once the play
    begins to assume new shapes&#8212;contours undreamt of by the
    author till that startling moment. And even if the author has
    the temerity to conduct his own rehearsals, similar
    disconcerting phenomena will occur; for the author as a
    producer is a different
<!-- Page 100 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page096" name="page096">[pg 96]</a>
    </span>

    fellow from the author as author. The producer is up against
    realities. He, first, renders the play concrete, gradually
    condenses its filmy vapours into a solid element.... He
    suggests the casting. "What do you think of X. for the old
    man?" asks the producer. The author is staggered. Is it
    conceivable that so renowned a producer can have so misread and
    misunderstood the play? X. would be preposterous as the old
    man. But the producer goes on talking. And suddenly the author
    sees possibilities in X. But at the same time he sees a
    different play from what he wrote. And quite probably he sees a
    more glorious play. Quite probably he had not suspected how
    great a dramatist he is.... Before the first rehearsal is
    called, the play, still without a word altered, has gone
    through astounding creative transmutations; the author
    recognises in it some likeness to his beloved child, but it is
    the likeness of a first cousin.</p>

    <p>At the first rehearsal, and for many
<!-- Page 101 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page097" name="page097">[pg 97]</a>
    </span>

    rehearsals, to an extent perhaps increasing, perhaps
    decreasing, the dramatist is forced into an apologetic and
    self-conscious mood; and his mien is something between that of
    a criminal who has committed a horrid offence and that of a
    father over the crude body of a new-born child. Now in truth he
    deeply realises that the play is a collaboration. In extreme
    cases he may be brought to see that he himself is one of the
    less important factors in the collaboration. The first
    preoccupation of the interpreters is not with his play at all,
    but&#8212;quite rightly&#8212;with their own careers; if they
    were not honestly convinced that their own careers were the
    chief genuine excuse for the existence of the theatre and the
    play they would not act very well. But, more than that, they do
    not regard his play as a sufficient vehicle for the furtherance
    of their careers. At the most favourable, what they secretly
    think is that if they are permitted to exercise their talents
    on his play there is a chance that they may be
<!-- Page 102 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page098" name="page098">[pg 98]</a>
    </span>

    able to turn it into a sufficient vehicle for the furtherance
    of their careers. The attitude of every actor towards his part
    is: "My part is not much of a part as it stands, but if my
    individuality is allowed to get into free contact with it, I
    may make something brilliant out of it." Which attitude is a
    proper attitude, and an attitude in my opinion justified by the
    facts of the case. The actor's phrase is that he
    <i>creates</i>

    a part, and he is right. He completes the labour of creation
    begun by the author and continued by the producer, and if
    reasonable liberty is not accorded to him&#8212;if either the
    author or the producer attempts to do too much of the creative
    work&#8212;the result cannot be satisfactory.</p>

    <p>As the rehearsals proceed the play changes from day to day.
    However autocratic the producer, however obstinate the
    dramatist, the play will vary at each rehearsal like a large
    cloud in a gentle wind. It is never the same play for two days
    together. Nor is this surprising,
<!-- Page 103 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page099" name="page099">[pg 99]</a>
    </span>

    seeing that every day and night a dozen, or it may be two
    dozen, human beings endowed with the creative gift are
    creatively working on it. Every dramatist who is candid with
    himself&#8212;I do not suggest that he should be candid to the
    theatrical world&#8212;well knows that though his play is often
    worsened by his collaborators it is also often
    improved,&#8212;and improved in the most mysterious and
    dazzling manner&#8212;without a word being altered. Producer
    and actors do not merely suggest possibilities, they execute
    them. And the author is confronted by artistic phenomena for
    which lawfully he may not claim credit. On the other hand, he
    may be confronted by inartistic phenomena in respect to which
    lawfully he is blameless, but which he cannot prevent; a
    rehearsal is like a battle,&#8212;certain persons are
    theoretically in control, but in fact the thing principally
    fights itself. And thus the creation goes on until the
    dress-rehearsal, when it seems to have come to a stop. And the

    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page100" name="page100">[pg 100]</a>
    </span>

    dramatist lying awake in the night reflects, stoically,
    fatalistically: "Well, that is the play that they have made of
    <i>my</i>

    play!" And he may be pleased or he may be disgusted. But if he
    attends the first performance he cannot fail to notice, after
    the first few minutes of it, that he was quite mistaken, and
    that what the actors are performing is still another play. The
    audience is collaborating.</p>

    <h3>I</h3>

    <p>I can divide all the imaginative writers I have ever met
    into two classes&#8212;those who admitted and sometimes
    proclaimed loudly that they desired popularity; and those who
    expressed a noble scorn or a gentle contempt for popularity.
    The latter, however, always failed to conceal their envy of
    popular authors, and this envy was a phenomenon whose truculent
    bitterness could not be surpassed even in political or
    religious life. And indeed, since (as I have held in a previous
    chapter) the object of the artist is to share his emotions with
    others, it would be strange if the normal artist spurned
    popularity in order to keep his emotions as much as possible to
    himself. An enormous amount of dishonest nonsense has been and
    will be written by uncreative critics, of course in the higher
    interests of crea

    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page104" name="page104">[pg 104]</a>
    </span>

    tive authors, about popularity and the proper attitude of the
    artist thereto. But possibly the attitude of a first-class
    artist himself may prove a more valuable guide.</p>

    <p>The
    <i>Letters of George Meredith</i>

    (of which the first volume is a magnificent unfolding of the
    character of a great man) are full of references to popularity,
    references overt and covert. Meredith could never&#8212;and
    quite naturally&#8212;get away from the idea of popularity. He
    was a student of the English public, and could occasionally be
    unjust to it. Writing to M. Andr&#233; Raffalovich (who had
    sent him a letter of appreciation) in November, 1881, he said:
    "I venture to judge by your name that you are at most but half
    English. I can consequently believe in the feeling you express
    for the work of an unpopular writer. Otherwise one would
    incline to be sceptical, for the English are given to practical
    jokes, and to stir up the vanity of authors who are supposed to
    languish in the shade amuses
<!-- Page 109 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page105" name="page105">[pg 105]</a>
    </span>

    them." A remark curiously unfair to the small, faithful band of
    admirers which Meredith then had. The whole letter, while
    warmly and touchingly grateful, is gloomy. Further on in it he
    says: "Good work has a fair chance to be recognised in the end,
    and if not, what does it matter?" But there is constant proof
    that it did matter very much. In a letter to William Hardman,
    written when he was well and hopeful, he says: "Never mind: if
    we do but get the public ear, oh, my dear old boy!" To Captain
    Maxse, in reference to a vast sum of &#163;8,000 paid by the
    <i>Cornhill</i>

    people to George Eliot (for an unreadable novel), he exclaims:
    "Bon Dieu! Will aught like this ever happen to me?"</p>

    <p>And to his son he was very explicit about the extent to
    which unpopularity "mattered": "As I am unpopular I am
    ill-paid, and therefore bound to work double tides, hardly ever
    able to lay down the pen. This affects my
<!-- Page 110 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page106" name="page106">[pg 106]</a>
    </span>

    weakened stomach, and so the round of the vicious circle is
    looped." (Vol. I., p. 322.) And in another letter to Arthur
    Meredith about the same time he sums up his career thus: "As
    for me, I have failed, and I find little to make the end
    undesirable." (Vol. I., p. 318.) This letter is dated June
    23rd, 1881. Meredith was then fifty-three years of age. He had
    written
    <i>Modern Love</i>

    ,
    <i>The Shaving of Shagpat</i>

    ,
    <i>The Ordeal of Richard Feverel</i>

    ,
    <i>Rhoda Fleming</i>

    ,
    <i>The Egoist</i>

    and other masterpieces. He knew that he had done his best and
    that his best was very fine. It would be difficult to credit
    that he did not privately deem himself one of the masters of
    English literature and destined to what we call immortality. He
    had the enthusiastic appreciation of some of the finest minds
    of the epoch. And yet, "As for me, I have failed, and I find
    little to make the end undesirable." But he had not failed in
    his industry, nor in the quality
<!-- Page 111 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page107" name="page107">[pg 107]</a>
    </span>

    of his work, nor in achieving self-respect and the respect of
    his friends. He had failed only in one thing&#8212;immediate
    popularity.</p>

    <h3>II</h3>

    <p>Assuming then that an author is justified in desiring
    immediate popularity, instead of being content with poverty and
    the unheard plaudits of posterity, another point presents
    itself. Ought he to limit himself to a mere desire for
    popularity, or ought he actually to do something, or to refrain
    from doing something, to the special end of obtaining
    popularity? Ought he to say: "I shall write exactly what and
    how I like, without any regard for the public; I shall consider
    nothing but my own individuality and powers; I shall be guided
    solely by my own personal conception of what the public ought
    to like"? Or ought he to say: "Let me examine this public, and
    let me see whether some compromise between us is not
    possible"?</p>

    <p>Certain authors are never under the
<!-- Page 113 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page109" name="page109">[pg 109]</a>
    </span>

    necessity of facing the alternative. Occasionally, by chance, a
    genius may be so fortunately constituted and so brilliantly
    endowed that he captures the public at once, prestige being
    established, and the question of compromise never arises. But
    this is exceedingly rare. On the other hand, many mediocre
    authors, exercising the most complete sincerity, find ample
    appreciation in the vast mediocrity of the public, and are
    never troubled by any problem worse than the vagaries of their
    fountain-pens. Such authors enjoy in plenty the gewgaw known as
    happiness. Of nearly all really original artists, however, it
    may be said that they are at loggerheads with the
    public&#8212;as an almost inevitable consequence of their
    originality; and for them the problem of compromise or
    no-compromise acutely exists.</p>

    <p>George Meredith was such an artist. George Meredith before
    anything else was a poet. He would have been a better poet than
    a novelist, and I believe that
<!-- Page 114 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page110" name="page110">[pg 110]</a>
    </span>

    he thought so. The public did not care for his poetry. If he
    had belonged to the no-compromise school, whose adherents
    usually have the effrontery to claim him, he would have said:
    "I shall keep on writing poetry, even if I have to become a
    stockbroker in order to do it." But when he was only
    thirty-three&#8212;a boy, as authors go&#8212;he had already
    tired of no-compromise. He wrote to Augustus Jessopp: "It may
    be that in a year or two I shall find time for a full sustained
    Song.... The worst is that having taken to prose delineations
    of character and life, one's affections are divided.... And in
    truth, being a servant of the public,
    <i>I must wait till my master commands before I take seriously
    to singing</i>

    ." (Vol. I., p. 45.) Here is as good an example as one is
    likely to find of a first-class artist openly admitting the
    futility of writing what will not be immediately read, when he
    can write something else, less to his taste, that will be read.
    The same sentiment has actuated an immense number
<!-- Page 115 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page111" name="page111">[pg 111]</a>
    </span>

    of first-class creative artists, including Shakspere, who would
    have been a rare client for a literary agent.... So much for
    refraining from doing the precise sort of work one would prefer
    to do because it is not appreciated by the public.</p>

    <p>There remains the doing of a sort of work against the grain
    because the public appreciates it&#8212;otherwise the
    pot-boiler. In 1861 Meredith wrote to Mrs Ross: "I am engaged
    in extra potboiling work which enables me to do this," i.e., to
    write an occasional long poem. (Vol. I., p. 52.) Oh, base
    compromise! Seventeen years later he wrote to R.L. Stevenson:
    "Of potboilers let none speak. Jove hangs them upon necks that
    could soar above his heights but for the accursed weight."
    (Vol. I., p. 291.) It may be said that Meredith was forced to
    write potboilers. He was no more forced to write potboilers
    than any other author. Sooner than wallow in that shame, he
    might have earned money in more difficult ways. Or he might
    have indulged in

    that starvation so heartily prescribed for authors by a
    plutocratic noble who occasionally deigns to employ the English
    tongue in prose. Meredith subdued his muse, and Meredith wrote
    potboilers, because he was a first-class artist and a man of
    profound common sense. Being extremely creative, he had to
    arrive somehow, and he remembered that the earth is the earth,
    and the world the world, and men men, and he arrived as best he
    could. The great majority of his peers have acted
    similarly.</p>

    <p>The truth is that an artist who demands appreciation from
    the public on his own terms, and on none but his own terms, is
    either a god or a conceited and impractical fool. And he is
    somewhat more likely to be the latter than the former. He wants
    too much. There are two sides to every bargain, including the
    artistic. The most fertile and the most powerful artists are
    the readiest to recognise this, because their sense of
    proportion, which is the sense of order, is well developed. The

<!-- Page 117 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page113" name="page113">[pg 113]</a>
    </span>

    lack of the sense of proportion is the mark of the
    <i>petit ma&#238;tre</i>

    . The sagacious artist, while respecting himself, will respect
    the idiosyncrasies of his public. To do both simultaneously is
    quite possible. In particular, the sagacious artist will
    respect basic national prejudices. For example, no first-class
    English novelist or dramatist would dream of allowing to his
    pen the freedom in treating sexual phenomena which Continental
    writers enjoy as a matter of course. The British public is
    admittedly wrong on this important point&#8212;hypocritical,
    illogical and absurd. But what would you? You cannot defy it;
    you literally cannot. If you tried, you would not even get as
    far as print, to say nothing of library counters. You can only
    get round it by ingenuity and guile. You can only go a very
    little further than is quite safe. You can only do one man's
    modest share in the education of the public.</p>

    <p>In Valery Larbaud's latest novel,
    <i>A.O. Barnabooth,</i>

    occurs a phrase of deep
<!-- Page 118 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page114" name="page114">[pg 114]</a>
    </span>

    wisdom about women: "
    <i>La femme est une grande realite, comme la guerre</i>

    ." It might be applied to the public. The public is a great
    actuality, like war. If you are a creative and creating artist,
    you cannot ignore it, though it can ignore you. There it is!
    You can do something with it, but not much. And what you do not
    do with it, it must do with you, if there is to be the contact
    which is essential to the artistic function. This contact may
    be closened and completed by the artist's cleverness&#8212;the
    mere cleverness of adaptability which most first-class artists
    have exhibited. You can wear the fashions of the day. You can
    tickle the ingenuous beast's ear in order to distract his
    attention while you stab him in the chest. You can cajole money
    out of him by one kind of work in order to gain leisure in
    which to force him to accept later on something that he would
    prefer to refuse. You can use a thousand devices on the
    excellent simpleton.... And in the process you may degrade your

    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page115" name="page115">[pg 115]</a>
    </span>

    self to a mere popularity-hunter! Of course you may; as you may
    become a drunkard through drinking a glass of beer. Only, if
    you have anything to say worth saying, you usually don't
    succumb to this danger. If you have anything to say worth
    saying, you usually manage somehow to get it said, and read.
    The artist of genuine vocation is apt to be a wily person. He
    knows how to sacrifice inessentials so that he may retain
    essentials. And he can mysteriously put himself even into a
    potboiler.
    <i>Clarissa Harlowe</i>

    , which influenced fiction throughout Europe, was the direct
    result of potboiling. If the artist has not the wit and the
    strength of mind to keep his own soul amid the collisions of
    life, he is the inferior of a plain, honest merchant in
    stamina, and ought to retire to the upper branches of the Civil
    Service.</p>

    <h3>III</h3>

    <p>When the author has finished the composition of a work, when
    he has put into the trappings of the time as much of his
    eternal self as they will safely hold, having regard to the
    best welfare of his creative career as a whole, when, in short,
    he has done all that he can to ensure the fullest public
    appreciation of the essential in him&#8212;there still remains
    to be accomplished something which is not unimportant in the
    entire affair of obtaining contact with the public. He has to
    see that the work is placed before the public as advantageously
    as possible. In other words, he has to dispose of the work as
    advantageously as possible. In other words, when he lays down
    the pen he ought to become a merchant, for the mere reason that
    he has an article to sell, and
<!-- Page 121 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page117" name="page117">[pg 117]</a>
    </span>

    the more skilfully he sells it the better will be the result,
    not only for the public appreciation of his message, but for
    himself as a private individual and as an artist with further
    activities in front of him.</p>

    <p>Now this absolutely logical attitude of a merchant towards
    one's finished work infuriates the dilettanti of the literary
    world, to whom the very word "royalties" is anathema. They
    apparently would prefer to treat literature as they imagine
    Byron treated it, although as a fact no poet in a short life
    ever contrived to make as many pounds sterling out of verse as
    Byron made. Or perhaps they would like to return to the golden
    days when the author had to be "patronised" in order to exist;
    or even to the mid-nineteenth century, when practically all
    authors save the most successful&#8212;and not a few of the
    successful also&#8212;failed to obtain the fair reward of their
    work. The dilettanti's snobbishness and sentimentality prevent
    them from admitting
<!-- Page 122 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page118" name="page118">[pg 118]</a>
    </span>

    that, in a democratic age, when an author is genuinely
    appreciated, either he makes money or he is the foolish victim
    of a scoundrel. They are fond of saying that agreements and
    royalties have nothing to do with literature. But agreements
    and royalties have a very great deal to do with literature.
    Full contact between artist and public depends largely upon
    publisher or manager being compelled to be efficient and just.
    And upon the publisher's or manager's efficiency and justice
    depend also the dignity, the leisure, the easy flow of coin,
    the freedom, and the pride which are helpful to the full
    fruition of any artist. No artist was ever assisted in his
    career by the yoke, by servitude, by enforced monotony, by
    overwork, by economic inferiority. See Meredith's
    correspondence everywhere.</p>

    <p>Nor can there be any satisfaction in doing badly that which
    might be done well. If an artist writes a fine poem, shows it
    to his dearest friend, and
<!-- Page 123 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page119" name="page119">[pg 119]</a>
    </span>

    burns it&#8212;I can respect him. But if an artist writes a
    fine poem, and then by sloppiness and snobbishness allows it to
    be inefficiently published, and fails to secure his own
    interests in the transaction, on the plea that he is an artist
    and not a merchant, then I refuse to respect him. A man cannot
    fulfil, and has no right to fulfil, one function only in this
    complex world. Some, indeed many, of the greatest creative
    artists have managed to be very good merchants also, and have
    not been ashamed of the double
    <i>r&#244;le</i>

    . To read the correspondence and memoirs of certain supreme
    artists one might be excused for thinking, indeed, that they
    were more interested in the
    <i>r&#244;le</i>

    of merchant than in the other
    <i>r&#244;le</i>

    ; and yet their work in no wise suffered. In the distribution
    of energy between the two
    <i>r&#244;les</i>

    common sense is naturally needed. But the artist who has enough
    common sense&#8212;or, otherwise expressed, enough sense of
    reality&#8212;not to disdain the
    <i>r&#244;le</i>

    of
<!-- Page 124 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page120" name="page120">[pg 120]</a>
    </span>

    merchant will probably have enough not to exaggerate it. He may
    be reassured on one point&#8212;namely, that success in the
    <i>r&#244;le</i>

    of merchant will never impair any self-satisfaction he may feel
    in the
    <i>r&#244;le</i>

    of artist. The late discovery of a large public in America
    delighted Meredith and had a tonic effect on his whole system.
    It is often hinted, even if it is not often said, that great
    popularity ought to disturb the conscience of the artist. I do
    not believe it. If the conscience of the artist is not
    disturbed during the actual work itself, no subsequent
    phenomenon will or should disturb it. Once the artist is
    convinced of his artistic honesty, no public can be too large
    for his peace of mind. On the other hand, failure in the
    <i>r&#244;le</i>

    of merchant will emphatically impair his self-satisfaction in
    the
    <i>r&#244;le</i>

    of artist and his courage in the further pursuance of that
    <i>r&#244;le</i>

    .</p>

    <p>But many artists have admittedly no aptitude for merchantry.
    Not only is their sense of the bindingness of a bargain
<!-- Page 125 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page121" name="page121">[pg 121]</a>
    </span>

    imperfect, but they are apt in business to behave in a puerile
    manner, to close an arrangement out of mere impatience, to be
    grossly undiplomatic, to be victimised by their vanity, to
    believe what they ought not to believe, to discredit what is
    patently true, to worry over negligible trifles, and generally
    to make a clumsy mess of their affairs. An artist may say: "I
    cannot work unless I have a free mind, and I cannot have a free
    mind if I am to be bothered all the time by details of
    business."</p>

    <p>Apart from the fact that no artist who pretends also to be a
    man can in this world hope for a free mind, and that if he
    seeks it by neglecting his debtors he will be deprived of it by
    his creditors&#8212;apart from that, the artist's demand for a
    free mind is reasonable. Moreover, it is always a distressing
    sight to see a man trying to do what nature has not fitted him
    to do, and so doing it ill. Such artists, however&#8212;and
    they form possibly the majority&#8212;can always employ an
<!-- Page 126 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page122" name="page122">[pg 122]</a>
    </span>

    expert to do their business for them, to cope on their behalf
    with the necessary middleman. Not that I deem the publisher or
    the theatrical manager to be by nature less upright than any
    other class of merchant. But the publisher and the theatrical
    manager have been subjected for centuries to a special and
    grave temptation. The ordinary merchant deals with other
    merchants&#8212;his equals in business skill. The publisher and
    the theatrical manager deal with what amounts to a race of
    children, of whom even arch-angels could not refrain from
    taking advantage.</p>

    <p>When the democratisation of literature seriously set in, it
    inevitably grew plain that the publisher and the theatrical
    manager had very humanly been giving way to the temptation with
    which heaven in her infinite wisdom had pleased to afflict
    them,&#8212;and the Society of Authors came into being. A
    natural consequence of the general awakening was the
    self-invention of the literary agent. The
<!-- Page 127 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page123" name="page123">[pg 123]</a>
    </span>

    Society of Authors, against immense obstacles, has performed
    wonders in the economic education of the creative artist, and
    therefore in the improvement of letters. The literary agent,
    against obstacles still more immense, has carried out the
    details of the revolution. The outcry&#8212;partly sentimental,
    partly snobbish, but mainly interested&#8212;was at first
    tremendous against these meddlers who would destroy the
    charming personal relations that used to exist between, for
    example, the author and the publisher. (The less said about
    those charming personal relations the better. Documents exist.)
    But the main battle is now over, and everyone concerned is
    beautifully aware who holds the field. Though much remains to
    be done, much has been done; and today the creative artist who,
    conscious of inability to transact his own affairs efficiently,
    does not obtain efficient advice and help therein, stands in
    his own light both as an artist and as a man, and is a
<!-- Page 128 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page124" name="page124">[pg 124]</a>
    </span>

    reactionary force. He owes the practice of elementary common
    sense to himself, to his work, and to his profession at
    large.</p>

    <h3>IV</h3>

    <p>The same dilettante spirit which refuses to see the
    connection between art and money has also a tendency to
    repudiate the world of men at large, as being unfit for the
    habitation of artists. This is a still more serious error of
    attitude&#8212;especially in a storyteller. No artist is likely
    to be entirely admirable who is not a man before he is an
    artist. The notion that art is first and the rest of the
    universe nowhere is bound to lead to preciosity and futility in
    art. The artist who is too sensitive for contacts with the
    non-artistic world is thereby too sensitive for his vocation,
    and fit only to fall into gentle ecstasies over the work of
    artists less sensitive than himself.</p>

    <p>The classic modern example of the tragedy of the artist who
    repudiates the world is Flaubert. At an early age
<!-- Page 130 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page126" name="page126">[pg 126]</a>
    </span>

    Flaubert convinced himself that he had no use for the world of
    men. He demanded to be left in solitude and tranquillity. The
    morbid streak in his constitution grew rapidly under the
    fostering influences of peace and tranquillity. He was
    brilliantly peculiar as a schoolboy. As an old man of
    twenty-two, mourning over the vanished brio of youth, he
    carried morbidity to perfection. Only when he was travelling
    (as, for example, in Egypt) do his letters lose for a time
    their distemper. His love-letters are often ignobly inept, and
    nearly always spoilt by the crass provincialism of the refined
    and cultivated hermit. His mistress was a woman difficult to
    handle and indeed a Tartar in egotism, but as the recipient of
    Flaubert's love-letters she must win universal sympathy.</p>

    <p>Full of a grievance against the whole modern planet,
    Flaubert turned passionately to ancient times (in which he
    would have been equally unhappy had he lived in them), and
    hoped to resurrect beauty
<!-- Page 131 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page127" name="page127">[pg 127]</a>
    </span>

    when he had failed to see it round about him. Whether or not he
    did resurrect beauty is a point which the present age is now
    deciding. His fictions of modern life undoubtedly suffer from
    his detestation of the material; but considering his manner of
    existence it is marvellous that he should have been able to
    accomplish any of them, except
    <i>Un Coeur Simple</i>

    . The final one,
    <i>Bouvard et P&#233;cuchet</i>

    , shows the lack of the sense of reality which must be the
    inevitable sequel of divorce from mankind. It is realism
    without conviction. No such characters as Bouvard and Pecuchet
    could ever have existed outside Flaubert's brain, and the
    reader's resultant impression is that the author has ruined a
    central idea which was well suited for a grand larkish
    extravaganza in the hands of a French Swift. But the spectacle
    of Flaubert writing in
    <i>mots justes</i>

    a grand larkish extravaganza cannot be conjured up by
    fancy.</p>

    <p>There are many sub-Flauberts rife in London. They are
    usually more critical
<!-- Page 132 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page128" name="page128">[pg 128]</a>
    </span>

    than creative, but their influence upon creators, and
    especially the younger creators, is not negligible. Their aim
    in preciosity would seem to be to keep themselves unspotted
    from the world. They are for ever being surprised and hurt by
    the crudity and coarseness of human nature, and for ever
    bracing themselves to be not as others are. They would have
    incurred the anger of Dr. Johnson, and a just discipline for
    them would be that they should be cross-examined by the great
    bully in presence of a jury of butchers and sentenced
    accordingly. The morbid Flaubertian shrinking from reality is
    to be found to-day even in relatively robust minds. I was
    recently at a provincial cinema, and witnessed on the screen
    with a friend a wondrously ingenuous drama entitled "Gold is
    not All." My friend, who combines the callings of engineer and
    general adventurer with that of serving his country, leaned
    over to me in the darkness amid the violent applause, and said:
    "You know, this
<!-- Page 133 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page129" name="page129">[pg 129]</a>
    </span>

    kind of thing always makes me ashamed of human nature." I
    answered him as Johnsonially as the circumstances would allow.
    Had he lived to the age of fifty so blind that it needed a
    cinema audience to show him what the general level of human
    nature really is? Nobody has any right to be ashamed of human
    nature. Is one ashamed of one's mother? Is one ashamed of the
    cosmic process of evolution? Human nature
    <i>is</i>

    . And the more deeply the creative artist, by frank contacts,
    absorbs that supreme fact into his brain, the better for his
    work.</p>

    <p>There is a numerous band of persons in London&#8212;and the
    novelist and dramatist are not infrequently drawn into their
    circle&#8212;who spend so much time and emotion in practising
    the rites of the religion of art that they become incapable of
    real existence. Each is a Stylites on a pillar. Their opinion
    on Leon Bakst, Francis Thompson, Augustus John, Cyril Scott,
    Maurice Ravel, Vuillard, James
<!-- Page 134 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page130" name="page130">[pg 130]</a>
    </span>

    Stephens, E.A. Rickards, Richard Strauss, Eugen d'Albert, etc.,
    may not be without value, and their genuine feverish morbid
    interest in art has its usefulness; but they know no more about
    reality than a Pekinese dog on a cushion. They never approach
    normal life. They scorn it. They have a horror of it. They
    class politics with the differential calculus. They have heard
    of Lloyd George, the rise in the price of commodities, and the
    eternal enigma, what is a sardine; but only because they must
    open a newspaper to look at the advertisements and
    announcements relating to the arts. The occasional frequenting
    of this circle may not be disadvantageous to the creative
    artist. But let him keep himself inoculated against its disease
    by constant steady plunges into the cold sea of the general
    national life. Let him mingle with the public, for God's sake!
    No phenomenon on this wretched planet, which after all is ours,
    is meet for the artist's shrinking scorn. And the average man,
    as to
<!-- Page 135 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page131" name="page131">[pg 131]</a>
    </span>

    whom the artist's ignorance is often astounding, must for ever
    constitute the main part of the material in which he works.</p>

    <p>Above all, let not the creative artist suppose that the
    antidote to the circle of dilettantism is the circle of social
    reform. It is not. I referred in the first chapter to the
    prevalent illusion that the republic has just now arrived at a
    crisis, and that if something is not immediately done disaster
    will soon be upon us. This is the illusion to which the circle
    of social reforms is naturally prone, and it is an illusion
    against which the common sense of the creative artist must
    mightily protest. The world is, without doubt, a very bad
    world; but it is also a very good world. The function of the
    artist is certainly concerned more with what is than with what
    ought to be. When all necessary reform has been accomplished
    our perfected planet will be stone-cold. Until then the
    artist's affair is to keep his balance amid warring points of
    view,
<!-- Page 136 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page132" name="page132">[pg 132]</a>
    </span>

    and in the main to record and enjoy what is.... But is not the
    Minimum Wage Bill urgent? But when the minimum wage is as trite
    as the jury-system, the urgency of reform will still be
    tempting the artist too far out of his true path. And the
    artist who yields is lost.</p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
